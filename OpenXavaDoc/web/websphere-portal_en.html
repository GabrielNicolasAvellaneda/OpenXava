OpenXava generates portlets applications compatibles with any JSR-168 compliant portal.
Hence the OpenXava applications are deployables in WebSphere Portal 5.1.<br>
In order to install your application in a WebSphere Portal you have to:
<ul>
<li>Secure that your application works well in WebSphere Application Server, for this 
	you may follow the instructions in <a href="/openxava/portal/websphere.psml">
	WebSphere with OpenXava</a>.
<li>Remove the reference to the WAR module from your <code>META-INF/application.xml</code> of
	your EAR file.
<li>Install your EAR in the Websphere Application Server that runs your portal 
	(tipically WebSphere_Portal), you can do it using <code>wsadmin</code> for example.
<li>Generate an OpenXava portlets application, you can do it using the ant target
	<code>deployPortlets</code>. The application will generate in your <code>dist</code> directory.
<li>Take the EJB jar generated on deploying in WAS (with all stub and skels) and
	copy it to <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> of your portlets WAR.		
<li>Deploy your portlet application (the WAR) in your WebSphere Portal as a normal
	portlet application.
<li>Now the portlets of your application are allowed to assign them to your page users
	as you wish.
</ul>

OpenXava applications are full tested in production with WebSphere Portal 5.1.
But working with WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Portal requires
some experience.<p>

Here some screenshots of an OpenXava application in WebSphere Portal:
