OpenXava applications are full tested in production with WebSphere
Application Server&nbsp;and WebSphere Portal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Any&nbsp;war generated by OpenXava using <span
 style="font-style: italic;">deployWar</span> ant target can be
deployed in a WebSphere Application Server, and any&nbsp;war generated
using <span style="font-style: italic;">deployPortlets</span> can be
deployed in a WebSphere Portal.<br>
<br>
Here some screenshots of an OpenXava application in WebSphere Portal:

Comments:<br>
<ul>
  <li>We don't advice you to use EJB2 (use Hibernate or EJB3
intestead), however OpenXava supports EJB2 with native CMP for
WebSphere,
you can look at&nbsp;<a href="/web/guest/was">WebSphere EJB2</a> or <a
 href="/web/guest/wps">WebSphere Portal EJB2</a> instructions.</li>
  <li>If you want to use EJB3 JPA you need at least to use a WebSphere
6.1.</li>
  <li>WebSphere Application Server 5.0 is tested with OpenXava until
1.2.1. It is not certified with OpenXava 2.x or better.</li>
  <li>WebSphere Portal 5.0 is not supported.</li>
  <li>Working with WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Portal
requires
some experience.</li>
</ul>
