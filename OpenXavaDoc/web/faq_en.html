<h4><a name="Why_to_use_OpenXava_if_we_have_Spring"></a>Why to use
OpenXava if we have Spring, Hibernate, JSF, EJB3 and so on?</h4>
Nowadays we live&nbsp;great times. It's true that Spring, Hibernate,
JSF and EJB3 are far better than J2EE 1.4. All these frameworks and
technologies are good (in fact OpenXava uses some of them), but if you
need to develop business application the amount of code to write
continues being&nbsp;big, and the productivity is low comparing
with&nbsp;other technologies
(Visual Basic, 4GL, Delphi, RPG, etc).<br>
OpenXava simply has a higher level of abstraction in order to obtain a
simple and easy way to develop business application with Java EE/J2EE
in a
Object Oriented fashion.<br>
If you do not believe me. Try it. See the demo applications, for
example the JBoss Seam Booking Demo developed with OpenXava, see the
code for it, and try to develop it with&nbsp;your favourite framework,
and compare &nbsp;yourself.
<h4><a name="Por_que_es_mejor_xava_que_una_solucion"></a>Why
OpenXava
is better than a MDA solution?</h4>
<p>We can talk about it's
different and not only better. With MDA we can
generate an application from UML models and in that way we reduce the
costs involved in our Development. In fact with OpenXava we make the
same
thing but we don't start from UML models we start from XML. </p>
<p>Now we have advantages from
this point of view beside the MDA model.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>XML is text , the advantages
are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't need sofisticated
tools, a single editor works fine.<br>
    </li>
    <li>There are many people than
prefers text to graphical. Yes, it's
true, one image is better than thousand words but is also true that
the text has been a very efficient way to send information during
centuries (at last the Latin was imposed to the ancient egyptian art of
writing). </li>
  </ul>
  <li>XML is extensible by nature,
it's very easy to add new features to OpenXava</li>
  <li>XML is very popular and has
a lot of validators and special
editors.</li>
  <li>XML is a very known standard.</li>
  <li>XML is very easy.</li>
</ul>
OpenXava and MDA aren't exclusive things, in fact you can create a MDA
tool over OpenXava, only need to generate the XML files in OpenXava
starting
from the UML model. <br>
<h4><a name="Por_que_xava_no_usa_Struts"></a>Why OpenXava does not use
struts?</h4>
<p>Struts allow to define the
control layer of a web application, OpenXava
has his own control framework. Struts is navigation between pages
oriented, while in the typical business applications the user can made
a
lot of actions in the same page. Struts for this last thing is
something complex, and the OpenXava control layer has been constructed
to
do so. </p>
<p>Another advantage from OpenXava
is that control layer isn't
dependable from web technologies, we could have by example one OpenXava
application with a different presentation technology (in fact there is
an OpenXava version to develop Swing applications).<br>
<br>
Many Struts Advanced Programmers are very exciting working with
OpenXava
to develop business applications. </p>
<h4><a name="Its_only_XML_no_Java_class"></a>It's only XML, no Java
class?</h4>
OpenXava uses JavaBeans to insert your custom functionality in the
application using the <a href="custom-code.psml">strategy pattern</a>.<br>
Moreover the upcoming OpenXava versi&oacute;n (3.0) will allow you to
use Java classes + annotations as alternative to XML for business
component definition.<br>
<h4><a name="How_scalable_it_is"></a>How scalable it is?</h4>
OpenXava generates a standard Java EE/J2EE application, hence it's as
scalable
as Java EE/J2EE.<br>
OpenXava uses EJB3 JPA, Hibernate or EJB CMP2 for persistence, and some
session
scope state at servlets level. The code
generated by OpenXava is good, but when you write your own
code&nbsp;you must to be wise in order to obtain a good performance,
specially in batch processes, but this is an issue of J2EE
not&nbsp;OpenXava.
<h4><a name="Con_que_sistema_de_gestion_de_usuarios"></a>What
type of
users manager system and navigation could you use with OpenXava?</h4>
<p>The modules generated by OpenXava are JSR-168 portlets, hence are
deployabled in any compliant Java Portal with its own security and
navigation features.&nbsp;<br>
OpenXava site is powered by Liferay Portal, therefore in this case the
Liferay security is used, but you can choose another portal or create
your own security and navigation framework for OpenXava modules.</p>
<h4><a name="Que_servidores_de_aplicaciones_estan"></a>What
Application Servers are supported?</h4>
OpenXava has been tested with:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Tomcat 5.5</li>
  <li>JBoss 4.0.x and&nbsp;3.2.x </li>
  <li>WebSphere 6.1, 6.0, 5.1&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Any Servlet 2.3 compliant container can execute OpenXava applications.<br>
If you want use EJB (optional in v2 or greater) you need at least a
J2EE 1.3
application server.<br>
If you want to use EJB3 JPA you need an application server with Java 5
support (a Java EE 5 server is not required).<br>
WebSphere 5.0 works fine with OpenXava 1.2.1, but it's not tested since
OpenXava 2.<br>
<h4><a name="What_Java_Portals_are_supported"></a>What Java Portals are
supported?</h4>
Any JSR-168 compatible portal. Although the next ones are tested:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Apache JetSpeed 2</li>
  <li>WebSphere Portal 5.1 and 6.0</li>
  <li>Liferay 4.1.x</li>
  <li>Stringbeans</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Que_herramientas_de_desarrollo_se"></a>What
Development
Tools can be used?</h4>
The downloaded OpenXava zip file has a configured workspace to use with
Eclipse. OpenXava is not using Eclipse resources but it's based in
the
Ant
Tool (which it's open source). You can use whatever IDE that you want
without problem or also from command lines. <br>
<h4><a name="Que_JDK_necesita_para_funcionar"></a>What
JDK need to run?</h4>
The OpenXava works with JDK 1.4.2,&nbsp;JDK&nbsp;5.0 and JDK 6.0.<br>
If you want to use EJB3 JPA you need at least Java 5.<br>
JDK 1.3.1 works fine with OpenXava 1.2.1, but it's not tested since
OpenXava 2.<br>
<h4><a name="Podemos_generar_con_xava_una"></a>Could
we generate a
non J2EE application using OpenXava?</h4>
It would be easy adapt OpenXava to do it because the OpenXava kernel
it's XML (also POJOs in v3)
and it hasn't strong links to EJB, Hibernate or Servlets (not as EJB3 +
JSF). To
construct a generator
to use with PDAs or two tiers applications (by example using swing)
it's easy. The initial OpenXava version was working with Swing +
EJB.
The latest one is working with JSP + Hibernate. All of these without
changes in your OpenXava applications. The OpenXava applications have
always
the same structure. <br>
With something of inventiveness you can even develop a .NET, PHP or
Ruby version. <br>
<h4><a name="Que_tipo_de_licencia_tiene_openxava"></a>What
licence type
has OpenXava? </h4>
LGPL. You can use OpenXava to develop every comercial project than you
want. The unique forbidden thing is developing your own comercial
version of OpenXava.<br>
