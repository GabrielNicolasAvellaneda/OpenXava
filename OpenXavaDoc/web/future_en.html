The OpenXava direction depends on its community.<br>
<h4>Version 3</h4>
The next release of OpenXava will allow you define components using
POJOs (EJB3 Entities) + annotations, as alternative to XML. The
advantages are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>You can take your application developed using EJB3 and convert it
in an OpenXava application in a few minutes.</li>
  <li>You can use standard tools for POJO/EJB3&nbsp;for developing
OpenXava applications. Tools as UML tools, Dali for mapping, Hibernate
tools for importing database schemas to EJB3 POJOs, etc.</li>
  <li>You do not need code generation any more.</li>
  <li>You can develop using Java.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 3.1 ?</h4>
OpenXava will&nbsp;support AJAX. Maybe adding some AJAX functionality
(by means of DWR?) for searching references, on change events,
validations, filling combos and so on.<br>

<h4>Other interesting areas of development</h4>
These feature are not planed yet, but they are very interesting, if
you want to implement some of them you &nbsp;are invited to do it.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse plugins</span>: A
Eclipse Plugin for OpenXava already exists but it can be improved. For
example, the possibility of creating a new OpenXava project from
Eclipse is easy to implements and it is an useful tool.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Annotations</span>: Improving
OX3 with annotation as @Property, @Reference, @Collection, @Calculator,
@Converter, @DefaultValue. These annotations can use APT for manipulating
bytecode or so.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">End application at Wiki Style</span>:
The possibility for the final user to add properties, references and
collection himself.</li>
  <li>Automatic <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Services</span>
generation: Easy to implement and useful.</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">FLEX</span> version</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">tool</span> developed using
OpenXava for <span style="font-weight: bold;">developing OpenXava
applications</span>.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">WSRP</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Workflow integration</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">MDA/EMF</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">library</span> of ready to
use <span style="font-weight: bold;">business component</span>
developed using OpenXava: Maybe this can be an independent project.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Do you want collaborate ? Do you have more ideas ?<br>
