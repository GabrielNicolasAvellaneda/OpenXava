OpenXava is a framework to develop easily business applications
with XML and Java.<br>
<br>
Its virtue resides in the fact that the heart of our applications is XML instead
of Java.<br>
For example, if you want a J2EE application that works with <i>Teachers</i> 
you only need to write this simple XML code:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE component SYSTEM "dtds/component.dtd"&gt;

&lt;component name="Teacher"&gt;

	&lt;entity&gt;
		&lt;property name="id" type="String" key="true"
			size="5" required="true"/&gt;
		&lt;property name="name" type="String" 
			size="40" required="true"/&gt;			  
	&lt;/entity&gt;
						
	&lt;entity-mapping table="MYSCHOOL@separator@TEACHER"&gt;
		&lt;property-mapping property="id" column="ID"/&gt;
		&lt;property-mapping property="name" column="NAME"/&gt;
	&lt;/entity-mapping&gt; 
				
&lt;/component&gt;
</pre>
And no more. No Java classes, no XML files for mapping objects, no design
of JSP or JSF pages, simply no more.<br>
OpenXava generates for you a complete J2EE application (with CMP EJB or Hibernate
for persistence) like <a href="MySchool">this</a>, and with a suitable User Interface for manage your <i>Teachers</i>.<br>
The resulting application allows you make CRUD operations, searching, filtering, ordering,
generating reports in PDF format, exporting to Excel, etc.<br>
In spite of its rapid development features, OpenXava is flexible enough 
to allow you to put your custom code in any part of the application.<br> 
With only simple XMLs and Java code in JavaBean format (really reusable Java classes) 
you can construct any J2EE business application in a very productive way.
In fact, a lot of critical business application, now in production, have been
developed with OpenXava.<br>
