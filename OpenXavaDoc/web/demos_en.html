Some demo applications developed with OpenXava can be executed in live from this portal.<p>

In order to execute the demos you only need to login using <b>demo</b> as user and
<b>demo</b> as password, and then you will see in the left menu the demo applications.<p>

Actually the installed demos are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="Booking">JBoss Seam Booking</a>: It's the booking application uses as
		demo in JBoss Seam framework but written with OpenXava. This demo has also a
		comparative of the two frameworks.</li>
	<li><a href="OpenXavaTest">OpenXavaTest</a>: This application is used to test all OpenXava features, hence
		is ugly and awkward. And, in spite of it uses Invoices, Customers, etc is not
		representative of a real life application.</li>
</ul>
