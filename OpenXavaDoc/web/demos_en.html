Here you can find some demo applications developed using OpenXava:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/web/guest/MySchool">MySchool</a>: It's used as
base&nbsp;for the tutorial. It's really
simple.</li>
  <li><a href="/web/guest/SeamBooking">Seam Booking</a>: An OpenXava
version of a demo&nbsp;from the&nbsp;JBoss Seam framework.</li>
  <li><a href="/web/guest/ProductSale">Product</a>: OpenXava
implementation
of a UML Enterprise Component
from the book Java Modeling In Color With UML (Coad, Lefebvre, De Luca).</li>
  <li><a href="/web/guest/OpenXavaTest/Description">OpenXavaTest</a>:
Application
used to test all OpenXava features (to
run full junit suite).</li>
</ul>
All the code for these demos are included in the OpenXava distribution.<br>
It's a shame, but the applications that really show all power of
OpenXava are
commercial applications and cannot be included here.<br>
<br>
If you want to contribute to OpenXava, creating a demo application and
contributing it to the project can be a good way. If you are interested
