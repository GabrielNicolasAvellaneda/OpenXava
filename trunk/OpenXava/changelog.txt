---------------------------
- On creating a new object from a reference the reference view is filled automatically with the just created object.
- Added 'as-aggregate' to <collection-view/> to allow entity collections behave as aggregate collections.
- Added exportSchema and updateSchema to OpenXava/build.xml (see example in MySchool/MiEscuela build.xml)
- It's possible to refine the default behavior of a collection-view with new new-action, save-action, hide-detail-action and remove-action elements in collection-view
- add/removeListAction and add/removeDetailAction added to view. This allow add/remove programmatically actions to a collection view.
- hiddenDetail action of Collection controller in controllers.xml is renamed to hideDetail.
- New stereotype ZEROS_FILLED/RELLENADO_CON_CEROS
- Feedback to the user of standard action are improved, specially those of collection.
- Searching a reference using radio button instead of checkbox, because only an item can be selected.

- The order of elements in entity/aggregate are more flexible.
- Converters (defined in converters.xml or MyComponent.xml) are applied for not generated code too. In this case conversion is only used for list mode, and the programmer is responsible to include the conversion in get/set code.
- Some adaptation a oracle syntax: Inner joins for tab works fine with Oracle (" as " dropped).
 OpenXava is refined in order to avoid this jetspeed flaw
- All text editors are limited to 100 displayed charecters as maximum. You can customize it for you applicaction using maxSizeForTextEditor in xava.properties.
- The textEditor.jsp editor has a new parameter 'maxSize' that is assigned to the 'size' attribute of html <input /> element. You can use it in your own steroetypes.
- workspace.dir in openxava.properties (or equivalent) is ignore by OpenXava. Therefore, from now on you can rename the folder of your workspace without worrying about to change your openxava.properties.
- Key with 0 as value works in searching
