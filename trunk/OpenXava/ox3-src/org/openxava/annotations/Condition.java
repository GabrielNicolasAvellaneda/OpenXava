 * You have full freedom to define how the collection data is obtained, 
 * with condition you can overwrite the default condition generated by OpenXava:
 * <pre>
 * @Condition(
 *   "${warehouse.zoneNumber} = ${this.warehouse.zoneNumber} AND " + 
 *   "${warehouse.number} = ${this.warehouse.number} AND " +
 *   "NOT (${number} = ${this.number})"
 * )
 * </pre>
 * If you have this collection within Carrier, you can obtain with this collection 
 * all carriers of the same warehouse but not himself, that is the list of his 
 * fellow workers. As you see you can use this in the condition in order to 
 * reference the value of a property of current object.
