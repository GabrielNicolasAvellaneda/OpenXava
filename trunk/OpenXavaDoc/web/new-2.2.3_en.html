<h4>Actions with no image can be displayed using buttons instead of links</h4>
OpenXava displays actions with no image associated to them using links,
but now it's possible to configure your application in order that OX
uses buttons instead. You only need to modify <span style="font-family: monospace;">xava.properties</span> and add:<br>
<pre>buttonsForNoImageActions=true</pre>
