The basic unit over OpenXava build applications are called Business
Components.<br>
<p> A Business component, or OpenXava component, stores all related
information about a business concept. <br>
Suppose the business concept Invoice, all related information about one
Invoice it's defined inside the Invoice.xml file. You define all
validations, stored data, business logic, graphical interface, tabular
data, mapping to databases, etc. </p>
<p>Usually to develop J2EE applications the developers teams make a
split
between different technical roles: graphical designer, business logic
programmers, deployers (to configure the application), etc. Opposite to
this point of view OpenXava propose a split based&nbsp;on the
functionality
and OpenXava has to solve technical aspects (graphical interface, data
access
, etc. ) We have verified that this way to manage our teams are more
efficient that the older ones. </p>
The Business Component approach is an alternative to the traditional
MVC frameworks. In MVC the code is classified in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">M</span>odel (the business logic), the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>iew (the User Interface) and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>ontroller (the behaviour). In
OpenXava the code is classified in Invoice, Delivery, Customer, etc.
That is, it's classified using business concepts as base.<br>
