How can I insert our tailored functionality in an OpenXava component?<br>

<p>The blue pieces are objects that you can insert in our components to
have our own functionality. We use the classic design pattern called
Strategy (or Policy). </p>
<p>These are the Strategic Objects that we can insert: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculators (ICalculator):</span>
Used to implement business logic. Have been used to calculated
properties, to calculate define methods. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validators (IValidator):</span>
Used to validate the input data entered by users. We can define at
property level or model level.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Converters (IConverter):</span>
Used to define conversion between Java types and database types. Needed
to make the mapping. Very useful when you are using legacy databases.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filters (IFilter):</span> With
our code allow to filter values to send to run one query with the
database manager. It's required to develop real applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>In adittion to the components there are other classes that allow to
define how works an OpenXava application.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Actions (IAction):</span> There
are the objects that react to the requests of the user. Are defined in
controllers.xml file..</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Formatter (IFormatter):</span>
We can specify how to convert from an html form (String) to a Java type
and vice versa. This way we can define the format of visualization of
the information and&nbsp;its transformation to Java.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generator
(IPropertyCodeGenerator):</span> We can define our own code generator
for several properties. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these Strategy Objects can be configured giving values to the
properties from XML. We can construct Strategy Objects configurables
that we can reuse several times. Now we have more XML code and less
Java code. We have sufficient functionality to adapt practically any
need in a business application. But if you want you can write
completely your EJB to manage the business logic, or the graphical interface
using JSP. Though this characteristic exists to take advantage of
already writed code and is not necessary when one writes new code.</p>
