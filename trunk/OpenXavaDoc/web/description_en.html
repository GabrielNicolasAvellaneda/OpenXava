OpenXava is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web
applications, like <span style="font-style: italic;">Ruby on Rails</span>,
but OpenXava produces&nbsp;standard
J2EE / JavaEE applications that can be deployed and any standard Java
Application Server (or standard Java Portal).<br>
The features that make OpenXava unique are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>It's really, really rapid and easy to
develop&nbsp;database-backed
applications.</li>
  <li>It's <a href="/web/guest/business-component">Business Component</a>
Oriented instead of MVC (look at <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openxava#Business_Component_versus_MVC">wikipedia</a>).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Generates automatically the User Interface from the business
component definitions.</li>
</ul>
OpenXava has been created by Java developers (who need developing Java
Enterprise applications in a productive
way) &nbsp;for their own use; hence it's&nbsp;powerful,&nbsp;extensible
and enjoyable
by a Java expert.<br>
In the other hand OpenXava allows to a new Java developer to start
rapidly to be productive, therefore is a pleasant experience for
beginners too.<br>
