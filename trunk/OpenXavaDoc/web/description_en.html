OpenXava is a framework to develop easily business applications
with
XML and Java.<br>
Its virtue
resides in the fact that the heart of our applications is XML instead
of Java.<br>
For example, if you like a J2EE application that works with <i>Pupils</i> 
you only need to write this simple XML code:
<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<!DOCTYPE component SYSTEM "dtds/component.dtd">

<component name="Pupil">

    <entity>
        <property name="number" type="int" key="true"
            size="2" required="true"/>
        <property name="name" type="String"
            size="40" required="true"/>             
    </entity>
                       
    <entity-mapping table="MYSCHOOL@separator@PUPIL">
        <property-mapping property="number" column="NUMBER"/>
        <property-mapping property="name" column="NAME"/>
    </entity-mapping>
               
</component>
</pre>
And no more. No Java classes, no XML files for mapping objects, no design
of JSP or JSF pages, simply no more.
OpenXava generates for you a complete J2EE application (with CMP EJB or Hibernate
for persistence), and with a suitable User Interface for manage your <i>Pupil</i>.<br>
The resulting application allows you make CRUD operations, searching, filtering, ordering,
generating reports in PDF format, export to excel, etc.<br>
But is flexible enough to
