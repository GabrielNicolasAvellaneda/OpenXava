<b>OpenXava has no security or user management system</b><br>
But you can use the security of your underlaying Java Portal. 
You should consult your portal documentation about security. 
Anyways here there are some tips for JetSpeed2.<br>

<h4>JetSpeed security and OpenXava</h4>
When OpenXava deploy portlets also generates propietary JetSpeed2 files.
These files are in <code>openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages</code> inside a folder named 
as your proyect.
For example, if your application is <i>Invoicing</i> these files are
in <code>openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages/Invoicing</code><br>.
All files (modules defined inside PSML files) in root folder (in Invoicing) 
are accessibles to users in group <i>Invoicing</i>, all files in subfolder 
customers (in Invoicing/customers) are accessibles to users
in group <i>Invoicing.customers</i>,
all files in subfolder reports of customers (in Invoicing/customers/reports) 
are accessibles to users in group <i>Invoicing.customers.reports</i>, and so on.<br>
Your only need use the Jetspeed Administrative Portlets to create the user groups
<i>Invoicing</i>, <i>Invoicing.customers</i> and <i>Invoicing.customers.reports</i> and assign your users
to this groups as you wish.
<p>
If you need a more granulated security, you can edit these files and to modify them.
See documentation about this in <a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/guides/guide-security-declarative-psml.html">
JetSpeed 2 Site</a>. Beware, because the JetSpeed2 files are overwrited by OpenXava
when you deploy the portlets again. Hence you need to configure your ant task in this way:
<pre>
&lt;target name="deployPortlets"&gt;
	&lt;ant antfile="../OpenXava/build.xml" target="deployPortlets"&gt;
		&lt;property name="<b>generate.jetspeed2.files</b>" value="false"/&gt;
	&lt;/ant&gt;		
&lt;/target&gt;	
</pre>

<h4>Data restriction by user</h4>
If you wish to restrict data depend on the current user, you can use
programmatic techniques. About this you can see the code in 
<code>org.openxava.filters.UserFilter</code>. In this case <code>request.getRemoteUser()</code>
is used to filter data. Furthermore, you can use the OpenXava API <code>Users.getCurrent()</code> to
obtain the name of the current user in any part of a OpenXava application.
