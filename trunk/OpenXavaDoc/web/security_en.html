<b>OpenXava has no security or user management system</b><br>
But you can use the security of your underlaying Java Portal. 
You should consult your portal documentation about security. 
Anyways here there are some tips for JetSpeed2<br>

<h4>JetSpeed security and OpenXava</h4>
When OpenXava deploy portlets also generates the propietary JetSpeed2.
These files are in openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages inside a folder named 
as the proyect.
For example, is your application is <i>MySchool</i> this files are
in openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages/MySchool<br>
These files are configured to grant all access to the application to
user of group 'MySchool', hence if you wish grant or deny access to
your application you must to create a new group (with JetSpeed Administrative Portlets)
named 'MySchool' and assign to it all the users of your election.<br>

If you need a more granulated security, you can edit these files and to modify them.
See documentation about this in <a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/bronco.html">
JetSpeed 2 Site</a>. Beware, because the jetspeed2 files are overwrited by OpenXava
when you deploy portlets again. Hence you need to configure your ant task in this way:
<pre>
	&lt;target name="deployPortlets"&gt;
		&lt;ant antfile="../OpenXava/build.xml" target="deployPortlets"&gt;
			&lt;property name="<b>generate.jetspeed2.files</b>" value="false"/&gt;
		&lt;/ant&gt;		
	&lt;/target&gt;	
</pre>
