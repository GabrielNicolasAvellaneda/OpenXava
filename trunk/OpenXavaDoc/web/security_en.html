<b>OpenXava has no security or user management system</b><br>
But you can use the security of your underlaying Java Portal. 
You should consult your portal documentation about security. 
Anyways here there are some tips for JetSpeed2.<br>

<h4>JetSpeed security and OpenXava</h4>
When OpenXava deploy portlets also generates propietary JetSpeed2 files.
These files are in <code>openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages</code> inside a folder named 
as your proyect.
For example, if your application is <i>MySchool</i> these files are
in <code>openxava.war/WEB-INF/pages/MySchool</code><br>
These files are configured to grant all access to the application to
the users of group 'MySchool', hence if you want grant or deny access to
your application you must to create a new group
named 'MySchool' and assign to it all the users of your election. You can do this
with JetSpeed Administrative Portlets.<br>

If you need a more granulated security, you can edit these files and to modify them.
See documentation about this in <a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/bronco.html">
JetSpeed 2 Site</a>. Beware, because the JetSpeed2 files are overwrited by OpenXava
when you deploy the portlets again. Hence you need to configure your ant task in this way:
<pre>
&lt;target name="deployPortlets"&gt;
	&lt;ant antfile="../OpenXava/build.xml" target="deployPortlets"&gt;
		&lt;property name="<b>generate.jetspeed2.files</b>" value="false"/&gt;
	&lt;/ant&gt;		
&lt;/target&gt;	
</pre>

<h4>Data restriction by user</h4>
If you wish to restrict data depend on the current user, you can use
programmatic techniques. About this you can see the code in 
<code>org.openxava.filters.UserFilter</code>. In this case <code>request.getRemoteUser()</code>
is used to filter data.
