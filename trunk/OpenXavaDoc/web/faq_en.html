<h4><a name="Why_to_use_OpenXava_if_we_have_Spring"></a>Why to use
OpenXava if we have Spring, Hibernate, JSF, EJB3 and so on?</h4>
Nowadays we live&nbsp;great times. It's true that Spring, Hibernate,
JSF and EJB3 are far better than J2EE 1.4. All this frameworks and
technologies are good (in fact OpenXava uses some of they), but if you
need to develop business application the amount of code to write
continues being&nbsp;big, and the productivity is low comparing
with&nbsp;other technologies
(Visual Basic, 4GL, Delphi, RPG, etc).<br>
OpenXava simply has a higher level of abstraction in order to obtain a
simple and easy way to develop business application with J2EE in a
Object Oriented fashion.<br>
If you do not believe me. Try it. See the demo applications, for
example the JBoss Seam Booking Demo developed with OpenXava, see the
code for it, and try to develop it with&nbsp;your favourite framework,
and compare &nbsp;yourself.
<h4><a name="Why_OpenXava_is_better_than_IBM"></a>Why OpenXava is
better than IBM WebSphere Studio or Rational Application Developer?</h4>
It's true that these tools from IBM are sophisticated and &nbsp;they
can be a good help in many circumstances, but OpenXava is a good
alternative, specially when you want developing business applications.<br>
Some advantages of OpenXava versus WebSphere Studio and Rational
Application Developer are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>OpenXava allows you developing more rapid and easily. Test
yourself, try to develop the example that comes with the OpenXava
tutorial using WebSphere studio. With the same level of functionality
and using the same technology (J2EE including EJB CMP), and you will
see it.</li>
  <li>OpenXava is a active code generator whereas WebSphere Studio is a
passive code generator.</li>
  <li>The price: OpenXava cost is 0 euros per developer, WebSphere cost
is...<br>
  </li>
  <li>OpenXava generates applications for JBoss and WebSphere (easily
extending to others) whereas WebSphere Studio only generates for
WebSphere Application Server.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Por_que_es_mejor_xava_que_una_solucion"></a>Why
OpenXava
is better than a MDA solution?</h4>
<p>We can talk about it's
different and not only better. With MDA we can
generate an application from UML models and in that way we reduce the
costs involved in our Development. In fact with OpenXava we make the
same
thing but we don't start from UML models we start from XML. </p>
<p>Now we have advantages from
this point of view beside the MDA model.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>XML is text , the advantages
are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't need sofisticated
tools, a single editor works fine.<br>
    </li>
    <li>There are many people than
prefers text to graphical. Yes, it's
true, one image is better than thousand words but is also true that
the text has been a very efficient way to send information during
centuries (at last the Latin was imposed to the ancient egyptian art of
writing). </li>
  </ul>
  <li>XML is extensible by nature,
it's very easy to add new features to OpenXava</li>
  <li>XML is very popular and has
a lot of validators and special
editors.</li>
  <li>XML is a very known standard.</li>
  <li>XML is very easy.</li>
</ul>
OpenXava and MDA aren't exclusive things, in fact you can create a MDA
tool over OpenXava, only need to generate the XML files in OpenXava
starting
from the UML model. <br>
<h4><a name="Que_diferencias_hay_entre_xava_y"></a><strong>What
differences are between OpenXava and XDoclet</strong>?</h4>
<p>XDoclet is very useful because
with only one Java class obtain the
same things than before using several Java classes and complex XML
files.<br>
OpenXava obtains the same from the point of view of one single XML
file.
Before OpenXava you needed several Java classes and complex XML files. <br>
XDoclet and OpenXava are similar, the main difference it's than in
OpenXava
you use XML and in XDoclet you use Java code.<br>
XML seems more natural to define Java and his logs because:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Permit hierarchical
structures.</li>
  <li>Validity and automatic
completion using XML editors..</li>
  <li>It's easier to learn by a
non Java Programmer. </li>
</ul>
The other big difference between XDoclet and OpenXava is that OpenXava
generates a full application, not only generates EJB code, with control
and graphical interface layers. And of course ready to use.<br>
XDoclet and OpenXava aren't opposite products, in fact OpenXava is
using
XDoclet to generate EJB code. If you want you can write EJB beans with
XDoclet and use it in OpenXava application. <br>
<h4><a name="Por_que_xava_no_usa_Struts"></a>Why OpenXava does not use
struts?</h4>
<p>Struts allow to define the
control layer of a web application, OpenXava
has his own control framework. Struts is navigation between pages
oriented, while in the typical business applications the user can made
a
lot of actions in the same page. Struts for these last thing is
something complex, and the OpenXava control layer has been constructed
to
do so. </p>
<p>Another advantage from OpenXava
is that control layer isn't
dependable from web technologies, we could have by example one OpenXava
application with a different presentation technology (in fact there is
an OpenXava version to develop Swing applications).<br>
<br>
Many Struts Advanced Programmers are very exciting working with
OpenXava
to develop business applications. </p>
<h4><a name="Its_only_XML_no_Java_class"></a>It's only XML, no Java
class?</h4>
OpenXava uses JavaBeans to insert your custom functionality in the
application using the <a href="custom-code.psml">strategy pattern</a>.<br>
<h4><a name="How_scalable_it_is"></a>How scalable it is?</h4>
OpenXava generates a standard J2EE application, hence it's as scalable
as J2EE.<br>
OpenXava uses Hibernate or EJB CMP2 for persistence, and some session
scope state at servlets level. The code
generated by OpenXava is good, but when you write your own
code&nbsp;you must to be wise in order to obtain a good performance,
specially in batch processes, but this is an issue of J2EE
not&nbsp;OpenXava.
<h4><a name="Con_que_sistema_de_gestion_de_usuarios"></a>What
type of
users manager system and navigation could you use with OpenXava?</h4>
<p>The modules generated by OpenXava are JSR-168 portlets, hence are
deployabled in any compliant Java Portal with its own security and
navigation features.&nbsp;<br>
OpenXava is bundle with a JetSpeed 2 and uses the security and
navigation of JetSpeed 2, but you can choose another portal or create
your own security and navigation framework for OpenXava modules.</p>
<h4><a name="Que_servidores_de_aplicaciones_estan"></a>What
Application Servers are supported?</h4>
OpenXava has been tested with:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Tomcat 5.5</li>
  <li>JBoss 4.0.x and&nbsp;3.2.x </li>
  <li>WebSphere 6.0, 5.1 and 5.0</li>
</ul>
Any Servlet 2.3 compliant container can execute OpenXava applications.<br>
If you want use EJB (optional in v2) you need at least a J2EE 1.3
application server.<br>
<h4><a name="What_Java_Portals_are_supported"></a>What Java Portals are
supported?</h4>
Any JSR-168 compatible portal. Although we use in production the next
ones:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Apache JetSpeed 2</li>
  <li>WebSphere Portal 5.1</li>
  <li>Liferay</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Que_herramientas_de_desarrollo_se"></a>What
Development
Tools can be used?</h4>
The downloaded OpenXava zip file has a configured workspace to use with
Eclipse 3.1. OpenXava is not using Eclipse resources but it's based in
the
Ant
Tool (which it's open source). You can use whatever IDE that you want
without problem or also from command lines. <br>
<h4><a name="Con_que_navegadores_de_internet"></a>What
Internet
Browsers are supported?</h4>
Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox.<br>
<h4><a name="Que_JDK_necesita_para_funcionar"></a>What
JDK need to run?</h4>
The OpenXava works with JDK 1.3.1, JDK 1.4.2 and JDK&nbsp;5.0<br>
<h4><a name="Podemos_generar_con_xava_una"></a>Could
we generate a
non J2EE application using OpenXava?</h4>
It would be easy adapt OpenXava to do it because the OpenXava kernel
it's XML
and hasn't strong links to EJB, Hibernate or Servlets (not as EJB3 +
JSF). To
construct a generator
to use with PDAs or two tiers applications (by example using swing)
it's easy. The initial OpenXava version was working with swing plus
EJB.
The latest one is working with JSP plus Hibernate. All of these without
changes in your OpenXava applications. The OpenXava applications have
always
the same structure. <br>
With something of inventiveness you can even develop a .NET version. <br>
<h4><a name="Que_tipo_de_licencia_tiene_openxava"></a>What
licence type
has OpenXava? </h4>
LGPL. You can use OpenXava to develop every comercial project than you
want. The unique forbidden thing is developing your own comercial
version of OpenXava.<br>
