<h4><a name="Why_OpenXava_is_better_than_IBM"></a>Why OpenXava is
better than IBM WebSphere Studio or Rational Application Developer?</h4>
It's true that these tools from IBM are sophisticated and &nbsp;they
can be a good help in many circumstances, but OpenXava is a good
alternative, specially when you want developing business applications.<br>
Some advantages of OpenXava versus WebSphere Studio and Rational
Application Developer are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>OpenXava allows you developing more rapid and easily. Test
yourself, try to develop the example that comes with the OpenXava
tutorial using WebSphere studio. With the same level of functionality
and using the same technology (J2EE including EJB CMP), and you will
see it.</li>
  <li>OpenXava is a active code generator whereas WebSphere Studio is a
passive code generator.</li>
  <li>The price: OpenXava cost is 0 euros per developer, WebSphere cost
is...<br>
  </li>
  <li>OpenXava generates applications for JBoss and WebSphere (easily
extending to others) whereas WebSphere Studio only generates for
WebSphere Application Server.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Por_qu&eacute;_es_mejor_xava_que_una_soluci&oacute;n"></a>Why
OpenXava
it's better than an MDA solution?</h4>
<p>We can talk about it's
different and not only better. With MDA we can
generate an application from UML models and in that way we reduce the
costs involved in our Development. In fact with OpenXava we make the
same
thing but we don't start from UML models we start from XML. </p>
<p>Now we have advantages from
this point of view beside the MDA model.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>XML is text , the advantages
are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't need sofisticated
tools, a single editor works fine.<br>
    </li>
    <li>There are many people than
prefers text to graphical. Yes, it's
true, one image is better than thousand words but is also true that
the text has been a very efficient way to send information during
centuries (at last the Latin was imposed to the ancient egyptian art of
writing). </li>
  </ul>
  <li>XML is extensible by nature,
it's very easy to add new features to OpenXava</li>
  <li>XML is very popular and has
a lot of validators and special
editors.</li>
  <li>XML is a very known standard.</li>
  <li>XML is very easy.</li>
</ul>
OpenXava and MDA aren't exclusive things, in fact you can create a MDA
tool over OpenXava, only need to generate the XML files in OpenXava
starting
from the UML model. <br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Que_diferencias_hay_entre_xava_y"></a><strong>What
differences are between OpenXava and XDoclet</strong>?</h4>
<p>XDoclet is very useful because
with only one Java class obtain the
same things than before using several Java classes and complex XML
files.<br>
OpenXava obtains the same from the point of view of one single XML
file.
Before OpenXava you needed several Java classes and complex XML files. <br>
XDoclet and OpenXava are similar, the main difference it's than in
OpenXava
you use XML and in XDoclet you use Java code.<br>
XML seems more natural to define Java and his logs because:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Permit hierarchical
structures.</li>
  <li>Validity and automatic
completion using XML editors..</li>
  <li>It's easier to learn by a
non Java Programmer. </li>
</ul>
The other big difference between XDoclet and OpenXava is that OpenXava
generates a full application, not only generates EJB code, with control
and graphical interface layers. And of course ready to use.<br>
XDoclet and OpenXava aren't opposite products, in fact OpenXava is
using
XDoclet to generate EJB code. If you want you can write EJB beans with
XDoclet and use it in OpenXava application. <br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Por_qu&eacute;_xava_no_usa_Struts"></a>Why OpenXava don't use
struts?</h4>
<p>Struts allow to define the
control layer of a web application, OpenXava
has his own control framework. Struts is navigation between pages
oriented, while in the typical business applications the user can made
a
lot of actions in the same page. Strut for these last thing is
something complex, and the OpenXava control layer has been constructed
to
do so. </p>
<p>Another advantage from OpenXava
is that control layer isn't
dependable from web technologies, we could have by example one OpenXava
application with a different presentation technology (in fact there is
a OpenXava version to develop Swing applications).<br>
<br>
Many Struts Advanced Programmers are very exciting working with
OpenXava
to develop business applications. </p>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Con_qu&eacute;_sistema_de_gesti&oacute;n_de_usuarios"></a>What
type of
users manager system and navigation could you use with OpenXava?</h4>
<p>The initial OpenXava versions
(using swing) had a security system and
navigation system. The latest version don't do it. These last version
generate a web module and the developer can crust in the security or
navigation framework to choose. A good option could be use OpenXava
modules as portlets and using it integrated with a portal (like
JetSpeed or Websphere Portal). This is the way to install in our
customers the OpenXava
applications. </p>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Qu&eacute;_servidores_de_aplicaciones_est&aacute;n"></a>What
Application Servers are supported?</h4>
OpenXava supports:<br>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;JBoss 3.2.x and 4.0.x</li>
  <li>WebSphere 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0</li>
</ul>
Using native EJB CMP2 for persistence.<br>
The work to adapt OpenXava to make
it
compliant with another J2EE server is easy.<br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Qu&eacute;_herramientas_de_desarrollo_se"></a>What
Development
Tools can be used?</h4>
The downloaded OpenXava zip file has a configures workspace to use with
Eclipse 3. OpenXava is not using Eclipse resources but it's based in
the
Ant
Tool (which it's open source). You can use whatever IDE that you want
without problem or also from command lines. <br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Con_que_navegadores_de_internet"></a>What
Internet
Browsers are supported?</h4>
Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox. The JavaScript level used is
low and we don't use CSS for layout. It's working fine with many
browsers<br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Qu&eacute;_JDK_necesita_para_funcionar"></a>What
JDK need to run?</h4>
The OpenXava works with JDK1.3.1, JDK 1.4.2 and JDK 1.5.0<br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Podemos_generar_con_xava_una"></a>Could
we generate a
non J2EE application using OpenXava?</h4>
It would be easy adapt OpenXava to do it because the OpenXava kernel
it's XML
and hasn't strong links to EJB and Servlets. To construct a generator
to use with PDAs or two tiers applications (by example using swing)
it's easy. The initial OpenXava version was working with swing plus
EJB.
The latest one is working with JSP plus EJB and it's possibly that
version 2 will work with JSP plus Hibernate. All of these without
changes in your OpenXava applications. The OpenXava applications have
always
the same structure. <br>
With something of inventiveness you can develop a .NET version. <br>
<h4><a name="&iquest;Qu&eacute;_tipo_de_licencia_tiene_openxava"></a>What
licence type
has OpenXava? </h4>
LGPL. You can use OpenXava to develop every comercial project than you
want. The unique forbidden thing is developing your own comercial
version of OpenXava. <br>
